      content="Several people around the world were confirmed positive for the coronavirus infection (Covid-2019), and several people have died in 206 countries/territories, and the infection had still shown no signs of abating. The numbers are changing almost by the hour, even as scientists and doctors around the world race to come out with a viable vaccine or treatment regimen and governments are working overtime to contain the spread. While misinformation, rumours and unscientific advice floats around, several organizations, institutions and agencies have come up with authentic information resources. This an attempt at categorising the available information in various resources & providing links."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
